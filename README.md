# CSV to log4shell markdown table format

Simple way to convert a csv file with data to the log4shell software readme markdown table format. In my use case I add multiple products to a Excel document as that makes it easier to copy paste from the site, once all data is done. I can export it to a CSV and run this script to generate the markdown table format for me to a text file, which I than can copy and paste to updat the software list.

I have also added a example csv file, for how it should look like.
